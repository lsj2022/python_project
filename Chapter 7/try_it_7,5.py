# 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on
# a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are
# between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is
# $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
# of their movie ticket.


age = input("How old are you?")
print(age)
age = int(age)

while age:
    if age < 3:
        print("your ticket is free")
        break
    elif age in range(3,12):
        print("your ticket is $10")
        break
    else:
        age > 12
        print('Your ticket is $15')
        break
